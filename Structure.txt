Classes:
    1) GSON conversion class
        a. need help with this one!
        b. might be a part of Game.java, but I'm not sure
    2) Game.java
        a. Ship objects (each named, needed for de-serialization)
            - string Name
            - int Length
            - Point start
            - Point end
        b. Point
            - int across
            - int down
        c. Functions
            - placeShip
            - fireShot
            - computer_placeShip
            - computer_fireShot

General Flow:
    1) The webpage calls Main to generate a game
        a. Main constructs Game object
        b. Game object sent to GSON converter
        c. GSON converter hands back JSON string
        b. Main sends JSON back to front-end
    2) Ship placement activated
        a. game state JSON sent to Main
        b. JSON sent to GSON converter
        c. GSON converter creates game object
        d. Converter hands object to Main
        e. Main calls Game.placeShip
            -needs to error check, not sure how to send an error
             to front-end <- gonna need implementation
        f. Main calls Game.computer_placeShip
        g. Main gives GSON converter Game object
        h. GSON converter hands back JSON string
        i. Main sends JSON string to front end
    3) Fire shot activated
        a. game state JSON sent to Main
        b. JSON sent to GSON converter
        c. GSON converter creates game object
        d. Converter hands object to Main
        e. Main calls Game.fireShot
        f. Main calls Game.computer_fireShot
        g. Main gives GSON converter Game object
        h. GSON converter hands back JSON string
        i. Main sends JSON string to front end
        ***(Need a way of detecting once all ships on a side have been sunk)***
    4) Game Over
